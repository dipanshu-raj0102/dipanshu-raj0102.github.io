  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

  <p class = "text-[14px] pt-2 "> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
  100% recommend! ”
